## Design

## Questions/Issues
- Overloading createCrowdsale failed! Compiles, runs with minimum # of args, but not with more! --separate factory for properties! *unsolved*
- Testing: one for factory, one for each contract type? Or a BIG one? *but should check ownership transfer!!*

## Next
- Finalization property: inherit? use factory? BOTH?! -- now inheriting.
- explore with final contract owning properties -- now implemented like this.
- tests CRASHING! out of gas, increasing limits but no dice :(
