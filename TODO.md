## Design

## Questions/Issues
- Overloading createCrowdsale failed! Compiles, runs with minimum # of args, but not with more! --separate factory for properties! *unsolved*
- Testing: one for factory, one for each contract type? Or a BIG one? *but should check ownership transfer!!*

## Next
- PropertyFactory, split abstraction, crfact takes two property vectors.
- real crowdsale
- I need to test ownership transfer from Factory!

## NOW
