# TODO

## Design
- Common interface for properties (by inheritance, will solve circularity in references?)
- More properties
- Crowdsale Factory: creation event vs. vector of crowdsales??

## Environment
- Implement tests

## Things
- Who keeps track of property values? Like cap value.

## Standing@
- uint _cap_ not working in constructor? at least not doing anything!!
- am I getting the address or not?? no, the txn.
- wait for mining? is this it?
- test access crowdsale, hairy.

## Questions
- whitelist for beneficiaires or purchase makers?
