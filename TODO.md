# TODO

## Design

## Questions
- Overloading createCrowdsale failed! Compiles, runs with minimum # of args, but not with more! --separate factory for properties! *unsolved*
- Testing: one for factory, one for each contract type? Or a BIG one? *but should check ownership transfer!!*
- how is it with property arrays that must be OUTSIDE?!

## Next
- Finalization property: inherit? use factory? BOTH?! -- now inheriting.

## Issues

## CHECK
- RETEST forwardFunds in crowdsale, went to PUBLIC
